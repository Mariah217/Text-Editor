# Mariah's Text Editor

## Description

This Text Editor allows you to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection. You can use this application without internet connection by selecting the 'install' button which is located in the upper left hand corner of the website. This allows you to reliably retrieve them for later use. It is very simple to use and extremly useful.
